## Flavours of diffusion

In the algorithm formalism, these are

$$
\begin{align}
& X^i_{t+1} = (X')^i_{t} + F^i_{t+1}(X') + \textcolor{red}{W^i_{t+1}}-\textcolor{red}{W^i_{t}},
\end{align}
$$

where $W_{it}$ is a standard Wiener process for each of the states indexed by $i$. Note that we may also allow for correlations between the noises in different dimensions.
