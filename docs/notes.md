## Notes

Inspired by the empirical dynamical modelling approach of [this work](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1417063112), but also desiring a generative model which has some link to the classic causal models promoted by mathematical ecology; the goal here is to create and calibrate a stochastic model which predicts the fish counts, weights, lengths and ages for each species in each area based on the past system states. To do this, we will combine some well-known models from mathematical ecology with supervised learning.


**IMPORTANT Data information to be aware of:**

- The surveys seem to [usually be conducted with electrofishing](https://environmentagency.blog.gov.uk/2016/05/11/how-we-carry-out-fish-surveys/) - which actually avoids harming the fish so that they can return to their population.
- `'Is Species Selective'` - this survey was focussed on a particular subset of species and so should not be used to get a representative sample of the whole population.
- `'Survey method'` - each method is distinct and so will not only give different k values for the negative binomial but also different means!!!

The one-step master equation for the proposed stochastic simulation is given implictly by

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{{\rm d}}{{\rm d} t} P(\dots, n_{i}, \dots, t) &= \sum_{\forall i}{\cal T}^{+}_{i}(\dots, n_i-1, \dots, {\sf f}, t)P(\dots, n_{i}-1, \dots, t) \\
&+ \sum_{\forall i}{\cal T}^{-}_{i}(\dots, n_i+1, \dots, {\sf f}, t)P(\dots, n_{i}+1, \dots, t) \\
&- \sum_{\forall i}\bigg[ {\cal T}^{+}_{i}(\dots, n_i, \dots, {\sf f}, t) + {\cal T}^{-}_{i}(\dots, n_i, \dots, {\sf f}, t) \bigg] P(\dots, n_{i}, \dots,t) \,,
\end{align}
$$

where the time $t$ is defined in units of years and ${\cal T}^{+}_{i}$ and ${\cal T}^{-}_{i}$ are the transition coefficients for the $i$-th species, which depend not only on the counts for all species $n_1, n_2, \dots$, but also (in principle) on a larger feature space ${\sf f}$ generated by the available data up to time $t$.

The famous [Lotka-Volterra system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equations), with some modficiations for fishing and a larger set of species, would suggest transition coefficients of the form

$$
\begin{align}
{\cal T}^{+}_{i}(\dots, n_i, \dots, {\sf f}, t) = {\cal T}^{+}_{i}(\dots, n_i, \dots) &= \Lambda_{i}(n_{i}) + n_{i}\alpha_{i}\sum_{\forall i' \, {\sf prey}}n_{i'}\\
{\cal T}^{-}_{i}(\dots, n_i, \dots, {\sf f}, t) = {\cal T}^{-}_{i}(\dots, n_i, \dots) &= n_{i}\mu_{i} +  n_{i}\gamma_{i} + n_{i}\beta_{i} \sum_{\forall i' \, {\sf pred}} n_{i'} \,,
\end{align}
$$

where: $\Lambda_{i}(n_{i}) = \tilde{\Lambda_{i}}n_{i}e^{-\lambda_i(n_{i}-1)}$ is the density-dependent birth rate; $\mu_{i}$ is the species death rate; $\alpha_{i}$ is the increase in the baseline birth rate per fish caused by the increase in prey population; $\beta_{i}$ is the rate per fish of predation of the species; and $\gamma_{i}$ accounts for the rate of recreational fishing per fish of the species. To approach the present data-driven simulation problem, we're going to generalise this model by training ${\cal T}^{+}_{i}(\dots, n_i, \dots, {\sf f}, t)$ and ${\cal T}^{-}_{i}(\dots, n_i, \dots, {\sf f}, t)$ directly from the data and generated features.

Look into the likelihood...

$$
\begin{align}
{\sf Likelihood} &= \sum_{{\sf data}}{\rm NB}\big[{\sf data};w_{i,{\sf survey}}\langle n_i(t_{{\sf data}})\rangle,k_{i,{\sf survey}}\big] \,,
\end{align}
$$
