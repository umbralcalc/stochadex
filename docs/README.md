## So what is the 'stochadex' project?

It's a simulation engine which can be used to generate samples from and statistically infer a whole 'Pokédex' of possible systems.

'Pokédex' here is just a fanciful metaphor for the large range of simulations that might come in useful when taming the complex descriptions of real world systems... and _kind of_ gives us the name 'stochadex'.

The hope for this project is that it can become the basis upon which to build generalised software solutions for a whole lot of different and interesting problems.

From a software engineering perspective, the stochadex simulation framework abstracts away many of the common features that sampling algorithms have for performing these computations behind a highly-configurable interface.

While the concept of a 'generalised simulation engine' isn't new (see, e.g., [SimPy](https://gitlab.com/team-simpy/simpy/), [StoSpa](https://github.com/BartoszBartmanski/StoSpa), [FLAME GPU](https://github.com/FLAMEGPU/FLAMEGPU2/) and loads more), this simulation engine is designed based on some deep research into [simulating a wide variety of real world systems](https://github.com/umbralcalc) and has a structure which allows for a lot of cool applications!
