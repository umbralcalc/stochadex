## So what is the 'stochadex' project?

It's a simulation engine written in Go which can be used to sample from, and learn computational models for, a whole 'Pok√©dex' of possible real-world systems.

For software engineers, the stochadex simulation framework abstracts away many of the common features that sampling algorithms have for performing these computations behind a highly-configurable interface.

While the concept of a 'generalised simulation engine' isn't new (see, e.g., [SimPy](https://gitlab.com/team-simpy/simpy/), [StoSpa](https://github.com/BartoszBartmanski/StoSpa), [FLAME GPU](https://github.com/FLAMEGPU/FLAMEGPU2/) and loads more), this simulation engine is designed based on deep research into [simulating a wide variety of real world systems over many years](https://github.com/umbralcalc) and has a structure which allows for a lot of cool applications.

## What can you do with this software?

One of the most compelling uses for simulation engines is to empower decision-making technologies.

In other words, if you want to answer questions like 'if I take this action, then what will happen in my system?', then it is often essential to build a simulation of your system and use this to simulate what might happen in the future.

The stochadex can be used to create these simulations and ensure that they behave in a way with closely matches the real data for the system that they are supposed to be modeling.
