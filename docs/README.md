## So what is the 'stochadex' project?

It's a simulation engine written in Go which can be used to sample from, and learn computational models for, a whole 'Pokédex' of possible real-world systems.

For software engineers, the stochadex simulation framework abstracts away many of the common features that sampling algorithms have for performing these computations behind a highly-configurable interface.

While the concept of a 'generalised simulation engine' isn't new (see, e.g., [SimPy](https://gitlab.com/team-simpy/simpy/), [StoSpa](https://github.com/BartoszBartmanski/StoSpa), [FLAME GPU](https://github.com/FLAMEGPU/FLAMEGPU2/) and loads more), this simulation engine is designed based on deep research into [simulating a wide variety of real world systems over many years](https://github.com/umbralcalc) and has a structure which allows for a lot of cool applications.
