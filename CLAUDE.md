# Stochadex — Claude Code Conventions

## Project Overview

Stochadex is a Go SDK for building, configuring, and running simulations of stochastic
processes and complex systems. Its execution model is **partition-based**: a simulation is
a set of independent components ("partitions"), each advancing its own state each step, run
concurrently by a coordinator and wired together through a small set of well-defined
channels.

- **Module**: `github.com/umbralcalc/stochadex`
- **Entry point**: `cmd/stochadex/main.go` → `api.RunWithParsedArgs(api.ArgParse())`

**Where the depth lives.** This file stays high-level on purpose. Packages with non-obvious
internal architecture carry a `doc.go` package comment that is the authoritative source —
**read it before working in that package**. In particular `pkg/agents/doc.go` (agent /
MCTS / MAST decomposition and cycle-breaking), `pkg/analysis/doc.go`, and
`pkg/inference/doc.go`. Load-bearing invariants are documented next to the code they
constrain (e.g. the `backupVisits` docstring in `pkg/agents/mcts_tree.go`) — trust and
preserve those comments rather than re-deriving the reasoning.

## Core abstraction: the Iteration interface

Every simulation component implements `simulator.Iteration`:

```go
type Iteration interface {
    Configure(partitionIndex int, settings *Settings)
    Iterate(params *Params, partitionIndex int, stateHistories []*StateHistory,
            timestepsHistory *CumulativeTimestepsHistory) []float64
}
```

- `Configure` runs once at setup — seed RNGs, allocate buffers, cache indices.
- `Iterate` runs each step, returning the partition's next state as `[]float64`.
- **`Iterate` must not mutate `params`** — the test harness checks this.
- **Keep iterations stateless between runs**: all mutable state must be re-initialisable in
  `Configure`, because the harness runs a simulation twice and compares outputs.

## How partitions fit together

Partitions are wired through the config, not by direct calls. The three channels:

- **`params_from_upstream`** — pipes one partition's current-step output into another's
  params. This is a **within-step** read: the consumer sees the producer's *this-step*
  value, so it imposes a computation order.
- **`params_as_partitions`** — resolves partition *names* to their integer indices and
  passes them as params (so an iteration can read another partition's state history by index).
- **State-history reads** — inside `Iterate`, reading `stateHistories[i]` gives partition
  `i`'s value from the **previous** step (lag-1), regardless of computation order.

**Cycle-breaking rule (general).** `params_from_upstream` is within-step and will deadlock
if two partitions depend on each other within the same step. Break the cycle by mixing
*one* within-step direction with *one* lag-1 (state-history) direction; the 1-step lag
aligns because the consumer applies the producer's previous output to its own state, which
has not moved since the producer ran. (The MCTS pipeline in `pkg/agents` is the worked
example — see its `doc.go`.)

Simulations are usually assembled with a `simulator.ConfigGenerator` (`SetPartition` /
`SetSimulation` → `GenerateConfigs`). `GenerateConfigs` validates wiring, e.g.
`params_from_upstream` indices against the upstream partition's state width.

## Config: two entry paths

1. **Programmatic Go** — build `Settings` + `Implementations` (or a `ConfigGenerator`)
   directly in Go. Used in unit tests and when embedding stochadex as a library.
2. **YAML API path** — define the run in YAML (`ApiRunConfig`); iteration types are Go
   expressions as strings (e.g. `"&continuous.WienerProcessIteration{}"`), with
   `extra_packages` / `extra_vars` declaring imports and variables. The API generates and
   runs Go from a template.

## Testing conventions

- Unit tests live beside source as `pkg/*/*_test.go`, using `t.Run("…", …)` subtests.
- **Always include a subtest that runs `simulator.RunWithHarnesses(settings, implementations)`**
  — it checks for NaNs, wrong state widths, `params` mutation, history-integrity, and
  statefulness residue (running the sim twice and comparing).
- Settings for a test are loaded from a colocated YAML file (e.g. `wiener_process_settings.yaml`).
- Compare floats with `gonum.org/v1/gonum/floats`, never raw `==`. No mocking — use real
  implementations.
- Integration tests in `test/` keep the `nbs/` notebook examples working. After adding a
  feature, extend the relevant `pkg/*` unit test, then ask whether to add an integration test.

## Domain-models catalogue (`models/`)

`models/` is a catalogue of real-world domains, each a **data-free, SDK-built stub of its
generative core** wired into engine CI. It replaced the old `template/` scaffold: rather
than pushing frozen structure downstream, applications teach the engine what good domain
models look like, and recurring bespoke extensions surface for promotion into core. The
repo boundary follows the **generative/inferential split** — this engine owns the forward
model; downstream repos own inference, data, calibration, and the decision layer.

The full spec (per-entry artifacts — `card.md`, `stub.go`, `stub_test.go`, the mandatory
`behaviour_test.go` expected-behaviour suite, and a `declarative.yaml` twin with its
equivalence test — plus the actionable/structural response-claim taxonomy and the two-category
promotion triage) lives in **`models/CONVENTIONS.md`**. Add entries with the `/new-model`
skill; the reference entries are `models/antimicrobial-resistance/`, `models/floodrisk/`,
and `models/energy-balancer/`.

**The declarative twin is the promotion triage.** Each entry is also stated as data
(`declarative.yaml`, a `general.ExpressionIteration` per partition, run through `pkg/api` with
no Go). Whether that twin can be written is the test: if it can, the bespoke Go is a
convenience and promotion is optional (earn it with a benchmark); if it cannot, the engine has
a real capability gap and one model is enough to prove it. Never change a model to make its
twin agree, and never widen a tolerance to hide a gap — step the oracle down instead
(exact → claim-level → distributional) and say which you used.

## Build, run, and docs

```bash
go build ./...                                   # compile all packages
go test ./...                                    # run all unit tests
go test ./pkg/continuous/...                     # test one package
go build -o bin/ ./cmd/stochadex                 # build the CLI
./bin/stochadex --config cfg/example_config.yaml # run a simulation
cd docs && bash build.sh                         # build HTML docs (needs pandoc + gomarkdoc)
```

## Code style

- Standard Go conventions (`gofmt`, idiomatic naming); exported types and functions have
  doc comments.
- Keep iteration implementations stateless between runs (see Core abstraction above).
- Put non-obvious package architecture in that package's `doc.go`, and load-bearing
  invariants in a comment next to the code — keep this file a map, not an encyclopedia.
